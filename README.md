<h2><em>✨ Purpose / Inspiration ✨</em></h2>
&emsp;The purpose of this website was for me to practice my web development skills and showcase my ability to make a professional website. This is not a real buisness, this is just a made up gym to show that I can make my websites as professional as some of the real gym's and companies websites.

<h2><em>⚙️ How It Works ⚙️</em></h2>
&emsp;The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device. 

&emsp;The navigation menu allows users to easily access various sections, including information about fitness classes, nutrition guidance, and personal training services. The contact form is integrated with Netlify, enabling users to submit inquiries and sign up for a free trial membership seamlessly.

&emsp;Multimedia content, including images and videos, is used throughout the site to engage users and provide a visual representation of the fitness club's offerings. The website also includes links to social media platforms, allowing users to connect with the club and stay informed about updates and events.
